> **Note**: Ludwig is currently in alpha development. Security updates will be prioritized for the current development branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Ludwig, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### üîí How to Report

**For security vulnerabilities, please do NOT create public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please:

1. **Email us** at: `security@ludwig-lang.org` (if available) or create a private security advisory
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
   - Go to the [Ludwig repository](https://github.com/NanaBright/ludwig)
   - Click on "Security" tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. **Include detailed information** (see below)

### üìã Information to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, code execution)
- **Location** of the vulnerable code (file path and line numbers)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof of concept** or exploit code (if applicable)
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### üìß Report Template

```

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Within 24 hours** | Acknowledge receipt of your report |
| **Within 72 hours** | Initial assessment and severity classification |
| **Within 1 week** | Detailed investigation and impact assessment |
| **Within 2 weeks** | Fix development and testing |
| **Within 1 month** | Public disclosure (coordinated with reporter) |

> **Note**: Timelines may vary based on complexity and severity of the vulnerability.

## Security Best Practices

### For Ludwig Users

When using Ludwig in your projects, follow these security best practices:

#### üåê Web Applications
```python
# Always validate user input
from validation import validate

user_data = request.get_data()
rules = {
    'name': ['required', 'string', 'max:100'],
    'email': ['required', 'email'],
    'age': ['integer', 'between:1,120']
}
validation_result = validate(user_data, rules)
```

#### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Applications
```python
# Sanitize file paths
import os
def safe_file_access(filename):
    # Prevent directory traversal
    safe_path = os.path.normpath(filename)
    if '..' in safe_path or safe_path.startswith('/'):
        raise SecurityError("Invalid file path")
    return safe_path
```

#### üîå Embedded Systems
```python
# Secure communication
device.add_service("wifi", Embedded.WiFiService(
    encryption="WPA3",
    certificate_validation=True
))

# Validate sensor data
def validate_sensor_reading(value):
    if not isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("Invalid sensor data type")
    if value < -50 or value > 200:  # Reasonable temperature range
        raise ValueError("Sensor reading out of range")
    return value
```

### For Contributors

When contributing to Ludwig:

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, certificates)
- **Use secure coding practices** (input validation, output encoding)
- **Test for common vulnerabilities** (injection, XSS, path traversal)
- **Follow the principle of least privilege**
- **Keep dependencies updated**

## Security Measures

Ludwig implements several security measures:

### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation
- Built-in validation system for all user inputs
- Parameter sanitization in CLI commands
- Type checking and bounds validation

### üîí Safe Execution
- Sandboxed execution environment for Ludwig scripts
- Restricted file system access
- Protection against code injection

### üì¶ Dependency Management
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency footprint

### üîç Code Analysis
- Static code analysis for security issues
- Regular security reviews
- Automated security testing in CI/CD

## Vulnerability Types We Monitor

### High Priority
- **Remote Code Execution** (RCE)
- **SQL Injection** (if database features are used)
- **Path Traversal** (file system access)
- **Authentication Bypass**
- **Privilege Escalation**

### Medium Priority
- **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) in web components
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF)
- **Information Disclosure**
- **Denial of Service** (DoS)

### Lower Priority
- **Security Misconfigurations**
- **Insecure Direct Object References**
- **Security Headers Missing**

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- **Prioritized** over feature development
- **Clearly documented** in release notes
- **Backwards compatible** when possible
- **Communicated** through multiple channels:
  - GitHub Security Advisories
  - Release notes
  - Documentation updates

## Third-Party Security

Ludwig may integrate with third-party services:

- **Web frameworks**: TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Python packages**: Various utilities and libraries
- **Embedded libraries**: Hardware abstraction layers

We monitor these dependencies for security issues and update them promptly.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- **Credit security researchers** who report vulnerabilities
- **Coordinate disclosure timing** with reporters
- **Provide updates** throughout the resolution process
- **Maintain confidentiality** until patches are available

## Security Hall of Fame

We recognize and thank security researchers who help keep Ludwig secure:
